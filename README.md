# Responsive Webpage Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my responsive webpage project repository! My name is Meet Daslaniya and I've created this webpage to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a primary focus on responsiveness. 

## Project Overview
This project is a culmination of my efforts to learn and implement responsive design principles. The main goal of this project was to create a webpage that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.

## Design Reference
I took inspiration from a design I created using Figma. You can view the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/PapgkGPrkBfuDDhyB9sJHV?type=design). The design provided me with a clear vision of how I wanted the final webpage to look and function.

## Deployment
I have deployed the webpage using Netlify, making it accessible to anyone to view and interact with. You can access the deployed version [here](https://vermillion-salamander-746b50.netlify.app/).

## Key Features
- Responsive design: The webpage is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: I used a combination of these technologies to create a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- Figma Design Reference: I utilized a design created in Figma as a reference point, ensuring a cohesive design and user experience.

## Conclusion
Creating this responsive webpage project has been a rewarding learning experience for me. It has not only allowed me to apply and enhance my skills but also provided me with valuable insights into the importance of responsive design in modern web development.
